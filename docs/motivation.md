# Motivation

What led to this development is my work on Docker applications that grew in complexity but needed to remain simple to set up and maintain for team members who didn't (and needn't) know the whole application in all its details. Working in a Digital Humanities context, most of them had only limited Docker and Ansible experience, if at all. Requirements to learn more about these technologies as well as requirements to install additional software beyond Docker on their machines needed to be kept to a minimum.

Similarly, I also like the idea of executing Ansible on a production machine without to deploy a complex Docker application without first having to install Ansible itself. Particularly if you only have limited influence on the server setup, this can be a bonus. If your server has a Docker Enginge installed, you can run CATPOD.
